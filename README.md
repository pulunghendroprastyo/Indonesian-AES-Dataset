 Automated Essay Scoring (AES) offers a scalable solution for assessing student essay, particularly in the context of Indonesiaâ€™s growing adoption of e-learning platforms. Manual scoring is often inefficient and inconsistent, highlighting the need for reliable automated systems. This study aims to evaluate ten Indonesian pretrained transformer models from Hugging Face for AES tasks, using essay responses from a Research Methodology quiz at Politeknik Negeri Ujung Pandang. Performance was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). Based on the experimental results, The Indobenchmark/indobert-base-p2 (BERT-02) model achieved the best results with an RMSE of 0.5664 and QWK of 0.6745. The findings suggest that BERT-02 is the most effective model for Indonesian AES tasks and can be considered a reliable option for educational applications. Future research could explore larger datasets and different models to further enhance the performance and understanding of Indonesian AES systems.
